@About id_rsa & id_rsa.pub
==
due to cvs always convert line end to CRLF, MUST use dos2unix to convert these two file

About vimrc dir
==
1. make sure init.vim is above other file
2. copy init.vim into ~/.shuw/
3. copy what you need *.vim into ~/.shuw/vimrc/

then append this sentense to .vimrc or .config/nvim/init.vim
```
source ~/.shuw/init.vim
```

if use windows, make g:mvcf_path point to mvcf/ dir
