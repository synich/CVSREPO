@# Usage
This is parser written by flex and lemon, so it's reentrant.

Implement `p2aPush`(used in lex) and `p2aReduce`(used in parse) in C function,
these two function can transfer control to script like Lua or JS.

Script name is fixed as `script.xx`, you should implement 2 global function named
`push(type, val)` and `reduce(action)`.
